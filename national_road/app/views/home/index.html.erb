        The National Road Corvette Club was founded in 2000 by Corvette enthusiasts from Clark County, Ohio. The club is named for the historic National Road (U.S. Route 40), which bisects the county and its county seat, Springfield. Since its founding, the club has grown to include members from members from several Ohio counties.
